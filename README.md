## Spatial-Temporal Diversity of Extrachromosomal DNA Shapes Urothelial Carcinoma Evolution and Tumor-Immune Microenvironment
Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) presents a promising target for cancer therapy; however, its spatial-temporal diversity and influence on tumor evolution and the immune microenvironment remain largely unclear. We apply computational methods to analyze ecDNA from whole-genome sequencing data of 595 urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients. We demonstrate that ecDNA drives clonal evolution through structural rearrangements during malignant transformation and recurrence of UC. This supports a model wherein tumors evolve via the selective expansion of ecDNA-bearing cells. Through multi-regional sampling of tumors, we demonstrate that ecDNA contributes to the evolution of multifocality and increased intratumoral heterogeneity. EcDNA is present in 36% of UC tumors and correlates with an immunosuppressive phenotype and poor prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses reveal that ecDNA+ malignant cells exhibit diminished expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, enabling them to evade T-cell immunity. Finally, we show that sequencing of urinary sediment-derived DNA has excellent specificity in detecting ecDNA.
