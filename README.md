## Spatial-Temporal Diversity of Extrachromosomal DNA Shapes Urothelial Carcinoma Evolution and Tumor-Immune Microenvironment
Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) presents a promising target for cancer therapy; however, its spatial-temporal diversity and influence on tumor evolution and the immune microenvironment remain largely unclear. Here, we apply computational methods to detect and reconstruct ecDNA from whole-genome sequencing data from 595 patients prospectively recruited into the Chinese Urothelial Carcinoma Genome Atlas (CUGA) study. We demonstrate that ecDNA contributes to clonal evolution through structural rearrangements and copy number variation during malignant transformation and recurrence of urothelial carcinoma (UC). This supports a model wherein tumors evolve via the selective expansion of ecDNA-bearing cells. Through multi-regional sampling of tumors, we demonstrate ubiquitous ecDNA presence across clones in multi-focal cancers, directly linking ecDNA to the evolution of multifocality. Notably, we observe highly variable levels of ecDNA across multiple foci within the same tumor, and ecDNA contributes to increased intratumoral heterogeneity and serves as a substrate for natural selection and evolution. EcDNA is present in 36% of UC tumors and correlates with an unstable cancer genome, an immunosuppressive phenotype, and significantly reduced 5-year survival. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses reveal that ecDNA+ malignant cells exhibit diminished expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, enabling them to evade T-cell mediated immune responses. Finally, we show that sequencing of urinary sediment-derived DNA has excellent specificity in detecting ecDNA, underscoring its diagnostic potential. This study delineates the evolutionary trajectory of ecDNA during tumor progression and provides further insights into immune evasion mechanisms associated with ecDNA.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89e1ae8a-e250-4bbf-aef1-c9e54871b809)
