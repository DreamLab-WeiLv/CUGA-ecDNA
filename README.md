## Spatial-Temporal Diversity of Extrachromosomal DNA Shapes Urothelial Carcinoma Evolution and Tumor-Immune Microenvironment
Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) presents a promising target for cancer therapy; however, the timing of ecDNA emergence (i.e., ecDNA clonality), and its role in shaping tumor immune microenvironment remain largely unclear. Here, we generate multi-omics profiling of 753 tumors, 296 adjacent tumor tissues, 195 blood samples, and 167 urine samples from 595 urothelial carcinoma (UC) patients. We demonstrate that ecDNA can be involved in the transition from early flat urothelial lesions to invasive cancer. During this process, clonal ecDNA evolves through complex structural and copy number variations. However, nearly 75% of ecDNAs are present in subclonal form, but not truncal, serving as a substrate for natural selection and tumor late-stage evolution. ecDNA was identified in 36% of UC cases and correlated with an unstable cancer genome, an immunosuppressive phenotype, and, most importantly, shortened patient survival. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed that ecDNA+ malignant cells express little to no major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, enabling evasion of T-cell responses. Finally, we show that urine sediment-derived DNA can noninvasively detect tumor-specific ecDNA. This study delineates the evolutionary trajectory of ecDNA during tumor progression and provides insights into immune evasion mechanisms associated with ecDNA.
