## Spatial-Temporal Diversity of Extrachromosomal DNA Shapes Urothelial Carcinoma Evolution and Tumor-Immune Microenvironment
Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) presents a promising target for cancer therapy; however, the timing of its emergence (i.e., ecDNA clonality) during tumor progression and its role in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment remain largely unclear. Here, we generate multi-omics profiling of 753 tumors, 296 adjacent tumor tissues, 195 blood samples, and 167 urine samples from 595 patients prospectively recruited into the Chinese Urothelial Carcinoma Genome Atlas (CUGA) study. We demonstrate that ecDNA can arise early in the transformation from flat urothelial lesions to invasive cancer. During this process, ecDNA undergoes continuous selection and evolution, driven by complex structural changes and copy number variations. However, through the multi-regional sampling of tumors, we detected ecDNA in at least one sample from 36% of UC tumors, with highly variable levels of ecDNA across samples, fostering increased intratumoral heterogeneity and acting as a substrate for natural selection and evolution. The presence of ecDNA correlated with an unstable cancer genome, an immunosuppressive phenotype, and, most importantly, shortened patient survival. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed that ecDNA+ malignant cells express little to no major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, enabling evasion of T-cell responses. Finally, we show that urine serves as a pooled substrate for detecting a broader spectrum of ecDNAs that may be present within a tumor. This study delineates the evolutionary trajectory of ecDNA during tumor progression and provides further insights into immune evasion mechanisms associated with ecDNA.
